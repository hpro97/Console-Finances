# Console-Finances
This Repo contains code for analyzing financial records

## Description 

I built this project to showcase my information gathering skills alongside what i've learnt the past 2 weeks in class regarding JavaScript. I created a Javascript file to analyze financial data provided to me with specific funtions to display an in depth view in the console log, all of this outputted from data that could potentially be changed "(numeric values anyways)". I checked for full functionality after completing each requesite provided to me, alongside comments to keep track of what i am doing and why, as to refer to this at a later date or if recycling code "(as i found i did a couple of times for different functions)" in a clear and consise way. This also improved the structure of my code as to give a clear definition of where a new requisite is being fullfilled with the code i have written and how my code corrolates to each function, accompanied by why and how it works with no need for further research from other sources "(in a self contianed way)".
